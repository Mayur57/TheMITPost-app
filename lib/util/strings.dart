///About Us Description
const String about = """
The MIT Post, formerly known as Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT)’s media team, originated as a segment of the MIT Editorial Board, eventually breaking off and emerging as a category in Techtatva and Revels. It became an independent body early in 2013 and was responsible for publishing a newsletter once in two months. The autumn of 2014 witnessed the growth of the old media team into its current form, the official media body and public relations and communication office of Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal.

Before any of that that, we were you.

Who are you? You’re not a student studying in one department hoping to land a job in that field. You are a mix of multiple schools of science; you’re anything from a genius in biomechanics who dabbles in drama to a world-class orator who tinkers with robots. You’re one in a body of 8000 such people where ideas aren’t limited by streams, and communication isn’t barred by classroom walls. You are MIT.

Through our website, magazine, and app, we will make sure you’ll always be informed.

We are your voice, a powerful medium that ensures that your ideas go above and beyond your dorm room window. You can expect nothing less from a college that bears the motto, “Knowledge is power”.

The Post aims to bring MIT to the world, and the world to MIT. In this venture, we will provide information on all activities that go on within the college, the opportunities that the students have to grow as engineers, musicians, artists, actors and writers, and project the spirit of MIT itself.

We aim to shape the rhetoric, to keep our fellow students informed of the world we live in, so that we may grow into intelligent decision makers and astute individuals of a modern world. We will be a platform to share great ideas and implement them in making a better MIT.

The MIT Post, its partners and its developers respect the user’s privacy and expect him/her to go through this document to understand how and where the data entered, and the data retrieved are being used. This is the privacy policy of The MIT Post app and all its content and services (all inclusively referred to as “Application”). The MIT Post app is owned and governed by The MIT Post (and all its subsidiaries ad sister organizations, referred to as “The MIT Post”, “we”, “us”, “our” and other terms of similar meaning).

Every transaction within the Application that involves transfer of sensitive data (such as SLCM registration number and password, and the related retrieved data including attendance and marks) are protected using the state-of-the-art AES-256 technology. The retrieved data is protected using multiple encryption modules to ensure safe data transfer between the Application and its backend server. Transfer of data between the Application and the server happens through SSL using HTTPS protocol for every transaction. This ensures a reliable transfer of data, and ensures authenticity, originality and security of the data entered by the user into the Application, and the data retrieved by the server and sent to the Application.

Every user’s data is cached (using AES-256). This data is present in a highly encrypted format, and can only be opened by the end-user through the Application. This data in no way is usable to anyone else other than the user who is using the Application by entering their respective registration number and password. Access to this data is not granted (even in encrypted format) to any of our partners or our subsidiaries. This data is kept safe and private, and the access to this is kept solely open to the user. The MIT Post is in no means responsible for any data stolen if the user leaves his/her account logged into someone else’s Application/Device, if he/she gave someone his/her SLCM PIN which is expected to be kept private and personal by the user for each SLCM session or if his/her SLCM credentials were revealed through any means by him/her to anyone else.

The MIT Post server caches necessary data of the user (their Application usage analytics, statistics, student academics data, notices, events etc.) to ensure a smooth experience for our users. These data collected help us deliver timely notifications, data updates and fast loading times to ensure productivity alongside security for our users. Any sensitive data that can be used to identify any individual, their age, their race, their gender or any other personal attribute are protected carefully using multiple keys and layers to ensure no organization (including our own) can get access to or make sense out of this data. This data collected will solely be usable by the user.

The data collected is intended to belong to our users who are above the age of 18. If any minor has logged into the Application or used it to enter any private/personal data, then his/her guardian/parent should immediately contact us, so we can ensure his/her data can be effectively taken down from our server, if any data was cached. We do not intend to collect any sort of data from any individual categorized as a minor.
